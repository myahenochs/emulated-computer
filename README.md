# emulated-computer
A small, emulated computer with a processor, bus, and RAM that I'm working on as a pet project. No particular hardware models are emulated. Currently not great. Referenced javidx9's NES implementation and wonderful tutorial.

Usage: The program will take input through the command line byte-by-byte in hexidecimal until it reads -1. Piping hex input from a text file with each byte separated by an end line is recommended.
